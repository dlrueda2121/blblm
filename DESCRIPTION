Title: Linear Regression with Bag of Little Bootstraps
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Diana Rueda
Maintainer: <dlrueda@ucdavis.edu>
Description: Implements linear regression through Bag of Little Bootstraps procedure. Combines features from bootstrap and subsampling with the option to use multiple cores for faster processing.
    Samples n from b with replacement. Samples s times into sizes of b. Then for each subsample it resamples each r times until sample size is n. Computes the bootstrap statistic for each bootstrap sample. Computes the statistic from the bootstrap statistics, and finally takes the average of the statistics.
